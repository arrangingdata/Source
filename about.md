My career in decision support has spanned many industries, including health care; manufacturing; e-commerce; engineering; insurance; marketing; FinTech; medical supplies; city, county, state, and federal government; retail; automotive manufacturing; and logistics. Learning what is common and what can be different between organizations and even across industries has been an invaluable resource.

I am most interested in promoting critical thinking and rigorous debate in our industry. Misinformation and a product focused trend in decision support that excludes best practices and lessons learned has made the current state of our industry well suited for success if you're a product vendor, but not so much if you're managing an organization's data assets.

Once upon a time, technology was promoted as a tool to help organizations be more efficient, productive, and cost effective. Today, it's primarily a cost center in most organizations. People in our industry should be working diligently to change that.
